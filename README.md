## Contributing

#### 1. Getting started

First you will have to fork the repository to your own account. Forking is as simple as clicking the fork button on the top right of the repository's page. After you fork the repository, you can clone the fork to your local machine.

#### 2. Development Pre-requisites

* NodeJS and NPM
If you are on Windows or Macintosh, you can get Node installed through [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). If you are on Linux, use your distro's package manager to install Node if it is not already installed.

#### 3. Setting up your environment

So far this is really straight forward. Once you have your fork cloned, using your terminal go to the directory of the local repository and use `npm install` to install any packages required by this project.

After that, you will have to copy `configBlueprint.js` to `config.js` and add your slack channel token to the config file.

To run the bot server, use `npm run test` in the root directory of the project.

#### 4. Workflow

If you have a feature or bug fix that you want to add to the project, you can add that under the issues tab. Then, you can work on developing that issue given that it falls in-line with the goals of the project ( i.e. the issue has been approved by a project owner). You can also just contribute by ideation and find another developer interested in your issue.

Another option is to work on an already approved issue that is still in progress; if you would like to do so, you should add a comment on the issue indicating that, and get the approval of the owner of the issue. If the owner is not active, then in the case that there are contributors to the issue (individuals working on resolving the issue), you can get their approval instead. Once that is done, you, the contributors, and the owner if possible, should organize your efforts through the issue's page, and delicate tasks according to what you see fit.

If you would like to work on the issue yourself, you should then make a new branch on your local repository (that will be the feature branch), having the issue number and title as its name. Make your changes there, pushing your changes to your fork of the repository. Once you think your code is ready for review, make a Pull Request from your fork's feature branch to the main repository's _master_ branch. Your code will be reviewed and tested, and any changes needed will be requested on the PR. Once the PR is fully reviewed, it will be merged to _master_ directly.

## Objective

The aim of the bot is to be able to take in a schedule and a topic, based on which it will act as a quick news feed by sending the user a single trending article or post relating to the specified topic. This should be done by either crawling the web for an trending entry, or through an API that can provide such a service.

## Current operation of the bot

If a direct message/mention is sent to the bot with a search topic, it will reply with a url of the top hit from Google news.

It parses the RSS feed response for results.

Send !help for a brief explanation of the bot.
